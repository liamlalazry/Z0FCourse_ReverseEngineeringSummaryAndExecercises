###  Compiled languages -
-  Translated directly into machine code 
-  all the code gets to machine code then executed.
-  the code is specific to a system 
- the result is an executable file or elf in linux
Advantages:
- Fast
- precise control on the hardware
Disadvantages:
- new compilation for each system 
- small change a whole new compilation

### Interpreted languages - interpreted/translated to machine code indirectly

- each part or even individual lines is translated then executed
- there is a translator software to translate the same code to multiple systems 
- sometimes line line sometimes block block
Advantages:
- very versitaile code
- faster development
- not need hand compilation 
- has a garbage collector in compae to compailed languages
Disadvantages:
- attend to be much because of runtime translation 
-  compiler makes optimizations to the final code which interpreter just cant do due to his run time interpreting.

### Intermidiate languages -compiled to ByteCode
its a kind of binary/executable that a system will not understand but can be distributed then an enviroment needed to be installed to translate to your system.
for example java language is translating code with environment called JRE - Java runtime environment which is the translator when excuting the program JVM - Java Virtual Machine (Part of JRE ) translates the bytecode to machine code that kind of compiler called JIT (Just In Time) compiler 
### Compare to Interpreted language
- Advantages: fast due to compilation before the running in compare to interpreted language like python. 
- due to the running in JVM u can check security in there isolated environment but for python there is no isolated enviroment.   
- On the Other Hand - interpreted languege (like python) is easier to debug ,dynamic typing, less infrastracure - less problems. 

#### .NET 
- similar to java
- contain many languages but c# is the .NET language 
- compiled into MSIL (Microsoft intemidiate language) similar to java bytecode 
- MSIL get into run by CRT - Commin runtime language it contains garbage collector (cleaning from memory what has no use anymore like memory already used by variable which no longer exists), JIT Compailer ( like Java JRE )  & security staff. 
### Python also has byte code and there is two main differences the way it interpret line-line or part part and that python ends with .py file while java or c# will end with executable.
