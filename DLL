Function overloading - helps for functions with the same name to do diffrent things for eample adding floats and adding integers with function called add() but sense the signature is differ the compiler knows the diffrence and the signature  is differ cause of the arguments number or types

Name Mangling in assembly there cant be function overload two functions cant have the same name even in c++ it can have as we saw the solution is a special inside name for the function which is called in assembly this is mangling making this weird name for same named functions

Demangling - the ability to reverse back the mangling made by the compailer to get more readable name.
